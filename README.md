# CS-370-Current-Emerging-Trends-in-CS

Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

The code I was provided included two Python files, TreasureMaze.py which represented the environment including the maze object, and GameExperience.py which stored the episodes. I was also provided with starter code in the Jupyter Notebook for TreasureHuntGame.ipynb which when completed would represent the pirate intelligent agent. The goal was to implement a Q-training algorithm so the agent could learn how to navigate and solve the maze. I had to complete the qtrain function using deep Q-learning which included initializing the state of the agent, implement exploration vs. exploitation, storage and leaning from past actions, and neural network training to assign Q-values to actions.


Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists develop , design, and analyze algorithms that can solve various problems. The work they do has applications in many different fields including healthcare, finance, travel, retail, etc. doing things like making processes more efficient or automating simple tasks. 

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

The way I would approach problems as a computer scientists would be to first try and understand the problem. Next I would try and break the main problem down into smaller more managable problems that are easier to work on. Once that is done I could begin to plan solutions with common techniques like pseudocode or making flowcharts. Next I would begin working on the actual code in segments making sure one segment works correctly before moving on to the next testing along the way. 

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

Some of my ethical responsibilities to the end user and organization include ensuring the privacy of their personal data, avoiding bias to make sure the algorithms operate in a fair way, proving a final product free of bugs and vulnerabilities, and being transparent about how the systems and algorithms work.
